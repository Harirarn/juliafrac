Finding julia sets and basin of attractions of complex polynomial functions.

There are the following files now:

Makes a fractal with possibly three attracting/parabolic fixed points. They are at 0, 1 and infinity. Modify (c1 + c2 i) to set multiplier of the fixed point at zero. Its basin of attraction appears in blue colour. Similary (d1 + d2 i) controls the multiplier of the fixed point at 1. Its basin of attraction appears in green colour. Set these numbers close the unit circle to get beautiful shapes (I mean dragons). The basin of attraction of infinity is in orange colour.
